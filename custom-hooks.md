### Custom Hooks

- We use custom hooks to create sharable functionality and improve code maintenance

#### TODO:

- Create usePosts hooks with relevant state and functionality
- Export the usePosts function
- Return the data in this function in an object
- Fetch relevant data on initialization
- Add methods for fetch all posts, create, update, delete posts
- Call this custom hook in app.tsx to get the object returned by this hook
- Pass these data and functionality through props and call them accordingly
